* **Telegram Web Mini App:** Seamless user experience within Telegram web apps, leveraging HTTPS for secure communication.
* **Asynchronous Backend:** Fast and scalable API with FastAPI and async SQLAlchemy for efficient data handling.
* **Task Queue:** Background tasks (e.g., notifications, reminders) managed by Celery, Celery Beat and RabbitMQ.
* **Responsive Frontend:** Built with Bootstrap and internal Telegram theme for a mobile-friendly interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System dependencies
- **Python 3.12**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Make** (for running Makefile commands)
- **Nginx** (with SSL certificates for production)
- **PostgreSQL** with **PostGIS** extension
- **RabbitMQ** for message brokering

## üåê Nginx certificates config
- **NOTE:** Receive SSL certificates to start application properly. 
- Place certificates to nginx/ssl.
- Rename `nginx/nginx-local.conf` to `nginx/nginx.conf` and configure it.

- Rename `.copy_env` to `.env` and configure it.
- Run `docker compose build` command then `docker compose up -d` to start the app.
- **NOTE:** Comment migration commands in `run_all.sh` after first successful applying migrations.

Make sure that SSL certificates is configured correctly  
Check `Makefile` to see all available commands.  

## üöÄ Start locally
* Ensure `PostgreSQL` and `RabbitMQ` are running locally.
* Change `Docker=False` in `.env` file.
* Use `run_all.sh` to apply migrations and fill db
* Run Celery ```celery --app src.celery_app.config worker --loglevel INFO```
* Run RMQ consumer ```python3 src/broker/consumer.py```
* Run app ```python3 -m src.app```
* Telegram Web Apps require HTTPS. Use `ngrok` for local running
  * ```ngrok http 8001 --url https://your_ngrok_url```
